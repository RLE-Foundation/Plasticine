## Plasticine: Clean Plasticity Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning

</div>

**Plasticine** is a library that provides high-quality single-file implementations of plasticity optimization algorithms in deep reinforcement learning. 


> **Plasticine** is built on the top of [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl).

## Quick Start
- Create an environment and install the dependencies:
``` sh
conda create -n plasticine python=3.9
pip install -r requirements/requirements-craftax.txt
```

- Clone the repository and run the training script:
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/Plasticine
cd Plasticine
sh scripts/std_ppo_craftax.sh
```
